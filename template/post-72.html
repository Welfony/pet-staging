            The connection between human food trends and pet food trends has
            been known to the pet food industry for years now. As pet food
            purchasers strive to provide their pets with the best food options
            available, the more specific health trends are gaining prominence
            and finding their way into specialty pet food formulations by way of
            so-called superfood ingredients.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The connection between human and pet has certainly grown
            exponentially over the last couple of years, with the general public
            wanting to treat and feed their animals the most highly nutritious
            foods that they possibly can,” said
            <strong>Lawrence Blitz, president of Green Source Organics</strong>.
            “I know there are a few brands out there that make the claim of
            human-quality food for pets, and others just try to find the
            highest-quality ingredients or ingredients that may have added
            health benefits. I think that really speaks to the bleed over from
            human to pet and what’s causing it. I think also that the perception
            that what’s good for us is also good for our pets, whether it be
            scientifically substantiated or not, plays a role.”
          </p>
          <h4>Trending: superfoods</h4>
          <p>
            Superfood ingredients, which usually come with at least one specific
            health benefit claim, can be found across the spectrum of foodstuffs
            — everything from pulses to fruits and vegetables to aquatic
            ingredients have options for pet food manufacturers to pull from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weight management is a significant pull for specialty pet food
            buyers, but there are other health and nutrition benefits consumers
            look for, as well, which means diversifying superfood options to
            suit a number of potential market needs. “With pet food mirroring
            human food so closely, we are seeing a need regarding all of the
            current dietary concerns,” said
            <strong
              >Casey Koehnlein, general manager for Marshal Ingredients</strong
            >. “Health benefits for sure. Yes, natural/organic, gluten free,
            particular formulations for stages of life, common ailments and
            activity levels. The wonderful thing is that superfoods address all
            of these concerns, and there is a superfood ingredient for each
            individual’s needs. Blueberry, apple, cranberry, tart cherry — all
            have specific attributes that perfectly address one or more of a pet
            owner’s concerns for their animal.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even aquatic ingredients are getting in on the trend. “In addition
            to the continued (and increasing) use of high-quality sweet potatoes
            and other grain-free options like chickpeas and lentils, we are
            seeing more and more diets containing aquatic mineral sources such
            as kelp, as well as aquatic proteins and oils with high levels of
            omega-3s,” said
            <strong
              >Lane Lott, business development and sales manager at Lortscher
              Agri Service Inc</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <h4>The future of superfoods in pet food formulations</h4>
          <p>
            With so many potential uses for superfood ingredients, the pet food
            industry is settling in for the long haul. “For now, the trend looks
            to be very stable and sustainable for several years to come,”
            <strong>said Lott</strong>. “As pet ownership expands with
            millennials, they are more ‘health’ conscious, it seems, as it
            pertains to their ‘children’ and tend to feel that if it is good for
            them then it must be good for their pets. The growth in this segment
            seems to also be getting a strong push due to companies looking more
            and more for ‘novel’ ingredients and other ingredients to bring to
            the deck as our sources of commonplace ingredients from the past
            become more and more limited. Without a doubt, the trend is spilling
            over into other pet food segments as ingredients like freeze-dried
            meats, fruits and vegetables become more readily available.”
