            No one could argue with the fact that humanization has proven a huge boon to pet food. With most pet owners
            considering their pets family members – especially in developed markets – humanization has been a
            significant driver behind the industry’s ongoing success, moving beyond trend status to a foundational
            force.

          <h4>
            Dogs and cats are not little people
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">During Petfood Forum 2019</strong>, a panel discussion focused
            on science versus marketing in pet food product
            development and the danger in letting the latter drive development at the expense of sound science on pets’
            nutritional requirements. As in other conference sessions, the need to better educate consumers about pet
            food and nutrition arose. <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Panelist Nicolas Nolf, founder and
              president of Atavik pet food company</strong>, thinks
            that need goes further: Owners need to better understand their pets in general, including their behavior,
            instincts and other unique characteristics, he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, all the panelists agreed that, while human food trends have driven consumer demands and pet food
            product development for some time now, what’s good for humans isn’t always good for dogs and cats. An
            example that comes to mind is the consumer demand for higher-protein human foods and beverages that has
            permeated pet food for several years, bolstered by the perception among some pet owners (and, let’s face it,
            encouraged by some pet food brands) that dogs and cats should be fed “as they would eat in the wild.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For people, such high-protein items are typically just one component of a varied, (ideally) balanced diet.
            Yet with pets, their pet food is all they get – and with high-protein products typically being very
            calorically dense, the pets often get too much of them because their owners may not understand the proper
            portions to feed, contributing to the pet obesity problem. <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">(Katy
              Nelson, DVM, the opening keynote speaker
              for Petfood Forum, even challenged the industry to “re-evaluate extremely calorically dense
              foods.”)</strong>
          </p>
          <h4>Humanization in pet nutrition mirrors pet behavior issues</h4>
          <p>
            This concept of human nutrition trends and needs possibly being misapplied to pets reminds me of
            decades-long efforts by animal behaviorists, veterinarians and other pet experts trying to help pet owners
            deal with pet behavioral issues by getting them to understand that – again – dogs and cats are not small
            people. We cannot expect them to think or act the same way we would or expect other people to.
          </p>
          <p>
            For dogs, olfaction is their “primary modality,” or way of interacting with the world, compared to us
            humans, who are visual, according to <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Alexandra Horowitz, Ph.D.,
              a professor at Barnard College</strong> who
            researches dog olfaction and behavior. “If we want to understand how dogs think, we need to understand their
            sense of smell,” she said in a presentation at Royal Canin’s Future of Animal Companionship Conference in
            October 2018 in Paris.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinatingly, her research has shown that dogs’ sense of smell is so acute and complex, they can even
            “smell through times,” detecting not only past odors plus future ones coming on the breeze. More pertinent,
            her research also demonstrates that many behavior “problems” can be explained by this drive to smell, which
            owners inadvertently block or fail to encourage. (For example, a dog jumping up on a person is its way of
            trying to smell the person’s face or breath.)
          </p>
          <p>
            As for cats, they are also more olfactory, at least in terms of how they communicate, as well as using body
            language and vocalizations to express themselves. <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Sarah Heath,
              BVSc, a certified animal behaviorist and
              external lecturer in small animal behavioral medicine at Liverpool University</strong>, who co-presented
            with
            Horowitz, said that perceived behavior problems arise with cats because their social behavior and ways they
            express emotions are very different than that of people and dogs.
