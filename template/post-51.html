          <h4>
            While movement restrictions may have hindered pet food ingredient production and delivery, one executive
            said his company managed to maintain on-time delivery despite lockdowns.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Despite the best efforts of any particular pet food industry business to prepare for the pandemic and deal
            with its effects, COVID-19 affected the entire supply chain. Globally interconnected pet food businesses may
            have suffered some delays and challenges as various countries dealt with the pandemic in their own ways.
            While movement restrictions may have hindered pet food ingredient production and delivery, one executive
            said his company managed to maintain on-time delivery despite lockdowns.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In a lot of cases, we’re relying on other parties, ”<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul
              Manning, president and CEO of Sensient Technologies</strong>, said “We’re relying on countries in lock
            downs or in lock downs that were staged in unusual manner, in my opinion.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially early in the pandemic, Sensient experienced problems with supplies from Asia, he said. However,
            while COVID-19 was still restricted in geographic range, the pet food colorant and other ingredient supplier
            stockpiled needed ingredients. That supply proved sufficient for Sensient to maintain nearly 95% on-time
            delivery to all customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation has been challenging, he said. Clever, resourceful employees have proven to be key in finding
            solutions to pet food supply chain problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensient operated production
            facilities, offices and labs around the world. Each one has had to adapt to local conditions.

            <strong>Providing leadership in pet food industry during pandemic</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Even in COVID-19 hotspots like Italy, Spain, the United States and China, Sensient employees have
            maintained productivity. For workers in facilities like labs and production plants, where remote work is
            impossible, attendance has been even stronger than before the pandemic.</p>
          <p>Pet food industry executives can help their companies by focusing on the vital mission of providing food.
            Along with an inspiring mission, employees also need effective infrastructure to keep them healthy and safe
            while fulfilling that mission.</p>
