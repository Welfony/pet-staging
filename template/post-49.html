          <p>If a dog or cat seems healthy eating a particular food, and it fits the owner’s criteria and desires in
            terms of ingredients, price and other attributes, they tend to stick with it. But does that purchasing
            behavior hold during a crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic? </p>
          <h4>
            Brand loyal so far, but still early days?
          </h4>
          <p>
            A recently released survey indicates many U.S. pet owners are remaining brand loyal during the crisis – yet
            this poll was conducted in early February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic really began hitting the U.S.
            at a high rate and people started stocking up on pet food or hoarding it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polling 3,200 U.S. consumers, <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Civic Science</strong> found that
            30% considered the brand the most
            important feature,
            by a lot, when shopping for pet food, with another 10% choosing the brand as most important by a little.
            While 46% considered the pet food brand and price equally important, only 14% chose price as the most
            important by a little or a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            These data are very close to ones from the previous year, when <strong
              style="text-decoration: underline;">Civic Science</strong> conducted a
            similar poll in
            February 2019. At that time, 33% chose pet food brand as the most important by a lot, followed by 8% as most
            important by a little; 45% considered it equally important to price, while 6% chose price by a little and
            8%, price by a lot. That poll involved 1,359 U.S. consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2019 poll also included an interesting question comparing pet food brand or price preference with the
            same preferences for human food for 355 respondents. Not surprisingly, there was a strong correlation: 64%
            of people who said they consider pet food brand the most important thing by a lot also considered it most
            important for their own food; 61% who considered pet food brand most important by a little chose the same
            response for their food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concern about pet food quality has also remained consistent from 2019 to 2020 – again, as of February. In
            2019, 77% of U.S. consumers polled by <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Civic Science</strong>
            said they were somewhat or very
            concerned about the
            quality of pet food they buy; in 2020, the percentage was 76%.
          </p>
          <h4>Pet food availability could be key</h4>
          <p>
            It would be helpful if Civic Science or another organization could conduct a poll in late spring 2020 and
            see if pet food brand and quality are still paramount to pet owners, or if those factors have declined in
            importance in favor of price, as more people become unemployed or lose sources of income.
          </p>
          <p>
            Availability could also be key. According to yet another survey of more than 1,000 U.S. consumers, nearly
            two-thirds have tried new brands during the crisis and subsequent stocking up of goods, with 79% of those
            doing so because their usual or preferred brand was out of stock. Conducted by <strong
              style="text-decoration: underline;">AlixPartners</strong> a business and
            management consultancy, the data also showed that at least a quarter of respondents who have tried new
            products plan to continue buying them post-crisis, with the percentage higher (30-45%) for new national
            brands tried, versus 25-30% for new private label brands tried.
