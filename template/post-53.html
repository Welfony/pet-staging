          <h4>
            The world is collectively experiencing nearly unprecedented supply chain challenges, and the pet food
            industry must meet them.
          </h4>
          <p>
            COVID-19 has caused global disruption at all levels as businesses have scrambled to take care of their
            employees, their products and their customers. For pet food manufacturers, as with other food-related
            segments of the market, being prepared for supply chain disruptions is part of doing business. But for the
            current exceptional uncertainties, companies are taking things a step further: solutions so far have
            involved diversifying suppliers and looking into alternate methods of getting their product where it needs
            to go, lessons every industry is swiftly learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The COVID-19 pandemic has hit global trade and investment at an unprecedented speed and scale,” said
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">trade specialists with the World Economic Forum</strong>.
            “Multinational companies faced an initial supply
            shock, then a
            demand shock as more and more countries ordered people to stay at home. Governments, businesses and
            individual consumers suddenly struggled to procure basic products and materials, and were forced to confront
            the fragility of the modern supply chain. The urgent need to design smarter, stronger and more diverse
            supply chains has been one of the main lessons of this crisis.”
          </p>
          <h4>Transportation challenges possible for the pet food industry</h4>
          <p>
            One of the major struggles for the transportation industry has been an air capacity shortage due to a 95%
            reduction in passenger flights — flights which also transport mail. At the same time, a 25–30% increase in
            e-commerce demand (and the resulting increase in packages needing to be shipped) has served to overwhelm a
            global system that is short-staffed and under-resourced.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The cancellation of more than 4.5 million passenger flights — the primary means of transporting post — has
            meant that capacity is scarce, costs more and takes longer,” said <strong
              style="text-decoration: underline;">Universal Postal Union Director General
              Bishar A. Hussein at the beginning of May</strong>. “Action needs to be swiftly taken to address the
            shortfall in air
            cargo capacity and to keep the mail moving.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">The U.S. Postal Service (USPS)</strong> has shifted some
            international air mail to sea transport, resulting in
            extended timelines for international shipments of goods. On May 16, 2020, for example, the third of such sea
            transports departed the East Coast of the U.S. with mail slated for Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Poland,
            Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. The transport’s estimated arrival
            date to its scheduled port in Rotterdam, Netherlands, is June 9. Of course once the mail gets to port, it
            must go through unloading, Customs clearance, transit to central sorting, acceptance and sorting, and road
            transit to its final delivery. All of that, according to the <strong
              style="text-decoration: underline;">USPS</strong>, can take 1–2 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some pet food manufacturers, particularly those with subscription services and online orders to fulfill,
            have been looking into more regional transportation options. Communication with customers, as always, has
            been key. By and large, consumers understand that these are exceptional times. But the average consumer has
            also likely not given much thought to how their orders arrive at their doorstep. For a world that is
            suddenly getting a crash course in the global supply chain, simply letting pet parents know why their
            product might be delayed, and what you’re doing about it, can go a long way towards gaining and retaining
            their loyalty.
