            Globally, pet owners may tend to be vegetarians and vegans at higher rates than average, which has
            repercussions for their plant-based pet food purchasing preferences.People who avoid eating animal products
            for ethical reasons face a moral conundrum when feeding their omnivorous dogs and carnivorous cats.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to a study conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States indicated
            that five hundred ninety-nine pet owners did not currently feed plant-based diets but expressed interest in
            doing so. Of these, 45 percent wanted more information about the nutritional sufficiency of plant-based pet
            foods for their animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise among all pet owners, nutrition topped pet owners list of concerns about plant-based pet foods.
            Farm animal welfare ranked as the top concern related to meat-based pet foods, with 39 percent of all
            participants reporting this.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Considering the number of pet owners found to be feeding, or interested in feeding, plant-based diets to
            pets, and the implications on pet health, nutrition, and the pet food market, more research is warranted
            regarding plant-based foods for dogs and cats,” wrote the scientists in their conclusions.
