            A study led by
            <strong>Purdue University’s Yaohua “Betty” Feng</strong>, an
            assistant professor of food science, showed that many Americans
            don’t wash their hands after feeding or playing with their cats and
            dogs and aren’t aware of the risk of contracting a foodborne illness
            from those activities, presumably from contaminated pet food. The
            <strong>Journal of Food Protection</strong> published the study,
            “Risk of Foodborne Illness from Pet Food: Assessing Pet Owners’
            Knowledge, Behavior, and Risk Perception.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Almost all dog and cat owners interact with their pets closely like
            cuddling, sleeping with them, kissing them, but after those
            interactions fewer than one-third of them wash their hands with
            soap,” said <strong>Feng</strong> in a press release. “They don’t
            really consider that they could get sick or that a foodborne
            pathogen could be transferred from their pet to themselves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Some dogs and cats do not have symptoms, even if they were
            contaminated with foodborne pathogens like Salmonella. There’s
            potential for them to share those pathogens with their owners when
            interacting with them,” Feng said.
          </p>
          <p>Survey of pet owners in United States</p>
          <p>
            According to the survey of more than 1,000 cat and dog owners in the
            United States:
          </p>
          <p>
            93 percent of pet owners cuddle their pets, 70 percent allow the pet
            to lick them, 63 percent sleep with their pets, and 61 percent kiss
            their pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only 31 percent wash their hands after playing with their pets, and
            42 percent do not wash their hands after feeding their pets.
          </p>
          <p>8 percent reported eating pet food and treats themselves.</p>
          <p>
            The study showed that 78 percent of people were not aware of recent
            pet food recalls or outbreaks associated with foodborne pathogens in
            those foods. One-quarter of people do not consider dry pet foods and
            treats as potential sources of these pathogens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Raw meat or raw animal product diets are growing in prevalence for
            supposed health benefits. The study showed that about 25% of
            respondents feed their pets raw foods, but about half of those
            people did not report washing their hands after those feedings and
            allowed their pets to lick them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feng said the results suggest that pet owners need more education
            about the safety of pet foods and proper handling of food and pets
            to prevent contracting an illness. She plans to develop materials
            that will address those issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some tips to keep pet owners from getting foodborne illness include:
          </p>
          <p>
            Wash hands with soap and water after preparing food for pets,
            petting or playing with pets, and before preparing food for people.
          </p>
          <p>Avoid feeding pets raw meat.</p>
          <p>
            Handle and store pet food carefully to avoid cross-contamination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep up with pet food recalls and keep records of pet food lot
            numbers and other information for potential tracking.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re not saying you shouldn’t hug your dog, but you should know
            the risks and how to protect yourself against the possibility of
            contracting an illness,” Feng said. “Learning the risk to your pet
            will make you an informed pet owner and avoid some of the pitfalls
            that could make you or your pet ill.”
