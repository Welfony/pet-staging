            Whey protein appears in many pet owners’ own diets, especially
            fitness-minded humans. Whey protein makes its way into energy bars,
            shakes, supplements, gels and baked goods. Pet food ingredient
            suppliers now produce whey protein. Likewise, pet products made with
            whey protein often are marketed for dogs with active, athletic
            lifestyles, such as Gorilla Max muscle supplement for dogs. In a
            survey conducted by WATT Global Media on behalf of a client,
            respondents said they used whey protein most frequently in
            high-protein/performance formulations. Puppy and kitten formulas
            used whey protein too, which makes sense since human milk
            replacements have used whey protein for decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            While minding their own health and that of their pets and children,
            pet owners increasingly care about the health and well-being of
            other people, livestock and wildlife. Pet owners likewise
            increasingly embrace lifestyles that reduce their resource
            consumption and pollution production. Whey results as a byproduct
            from cheese and yogurt production. Making use of byproducts, or
            co-products, in pet food reduces waste and increases farmers’
            income, while allowing the pet food brand to make sustainability
            marketing claims. In a study published in the journal
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline">Sustainability</strong>,
            researchers calculated that whey had the second lowest environmental
            impact of more than 30 proteins sources, ranging from beef as the
            most to peanuts as the least.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barriers to use of whey protein in pet food While pet foods and
            treats use whey protein, barriers remain. Survey respondents said
            they most need nutritional information and empirical research on
            whey in dog, cat and other pet diets, before using the ingredient in
            their pet foods, treats and supplements. However, researchers
            haven’t focused much on whey protein in pets diets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with a scarcity of published research, a barrier to wider use
            of whey protein in pet foods may be the price. Cost was the primary
            reason survey respondents said they did not use whey protein.
          </p>
          <p>
            Survey participants did see an opportunity for whey in their pet
            foods, treats and other products. Life-stage products, such as puppy
            or senior formulations, seems relevant formulations for whey protein
            inclusion. Grain-free products were another option, as were extruded
            foods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pet food producers have several whey protein products to choose
            from. Whey protein producers sell their product based on its
            concentration and processing method. Whey protein concentrate
            generally contains 70% to 80% protein. Whey protein isolate holds
            typically more than 90% protein. Processors use enzymes, or
            chemicals that facilitate reactions, to break whey protein
            hydrolysate into its constituent molecules, called peptides, and is
            typically 80% protein. Regardless of the type of whey protein used,
            price and lack of research may hold back wider adoption as a pet
            food ingredient, while human food and health trends may boost its
            use.
