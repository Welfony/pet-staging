          <h4>
            Pet food supply chain during COVID-19
          </h4>
          <p>
            Smaller pet food brands have potentially less ability to adapt to
            supply chain problems, these brands especially need to focus on
            flexibility and capacity to maintain shelf presence and get products
            to market. This pressure on small brands could influence business
            strategy.
          </p>
          <h4>Pet food sales channels during pandemic</h4>
          <p>
            The pet specialty and veterinary channels have seen an ongoing,
            significant drop in traffic, Pet owners don’t want to spend time
            browsing in pet specialty shops, or using grooming services.
            Instead, purpose-driven shoppers make quick visits for specific
            items, not stopping to share pet food tips with other customers.
            Likewise, veterinary visits are kept to a minimum. At the same time,
            pet owners buy more products online. Pet food subscriptions lock
            consumers in and maintain them for the long haul.
          </p>
          <h4>Pet ownership trends during pandemic</h4>
          <p>
            Pets have filled in for friends and family as people stay home
            during the pandemic. “People spending more time at home with their
            pets developing that bond gives you an opportunity to innovate
            market around those pet owner and those owner bonds that are that
            are growing as well as new pet owners who are coming into this space
            for the first time during COVID-19.”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, pet owners traditional means of socializing with each other
            have also been altered. Pet owners no longer take their animals with
            them to stores, reducing the experiential element of the retail
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what are other ways that pet owners can socialize and engage with
            one another in online forums or other types of environments?”<strong

              said.</strong

          <p>
            Pet food brands can find new tools for owner engagement in a digital
            world, whether that's live streaming a pet sampling a product, or
            engaging via pet owner platforms, he said.
