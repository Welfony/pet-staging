            Considered a functional ingredient, Chicken Protein Hydrolysate can
            add important benefits to the nutrition of pets. In addition to
            being highly palatable and to stimulate animal feeding, the
            enzymatic hydrolysis process improves animal health due to better
            absorption of nutrients with functional properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in order to ensure that all benefits are actually
            introduced actively into the feed, itâ€™s necessary to consider some
            fundamental characteristics when choosing the supplier.
          </p>
          <h4>Proven results: Chicken Protein Hydrolysate (CPH)</h4>
          <p>
            Chicken Protein Hydrolysate is a high-performance functional
            ingredient for animal nutrition. Therefore, it is used in the
            formulation of feed and pet food in order to improve the health and
            well-being of dogs and cats.
          </p>
          <p>
            CPH is produced through the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of
            proteins present in chicken guts, chicken giblets and chicken meat.
            As a result, smaller chains of amino acids and bioactive peptides
            are formed.
          </p>
          <h4>Greater digestibility and palatability</h4>
          <p>
            Enzymatic hydrolysis enables the production of ingredients with a
            minimum digestibility of 90%, which is excellent for guaranteeing
            the nutritional potential of pet food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another factor of great relevance in the quality of the feed is
            palatability. When it is low, it can affect the frequency of animal
            feeding, interfering with the pet's nutrition and health. An
            ingredient with naturally differentiated palatability and which has
            the support of 15% free amino acids and bioactive peptides is the
            Chicken Protein Hydrolysate.
          </p>
          <h4>Composition rich in amino acids and high protein content</h4>
          <p>
            The choice of a quality raw material can guarantee the ideal levels
            of amino acids and proteins in the formulation of the feed. In
            addition to the naturally balanced amino acid composition of the raw
            material, enzymatic hydrolysis ensures that they are more available
            to pets.
