          <h4>
            U.S. pet owners not (yet) decreasing spending on pet food
          </h4>
          <p>
            A new report on the U.S. pet food market indicates few dog and cat
            owners are spending less on food for their pets – based on a survey
            conducted by Packaged Facts in April and May 2020. As the country
            struggles to contain escalating cases of COVID-19, unemployment and
            financial hardship are also increasing. That could eventually affect
            how much pet owners can spend.
          </p>
          <h4>U.S. pet food market still growing</h4>
          <p>
            The report covers only dog and cat food, plus toppers and mixers,
            and does not include treats and chews. Given those parameters, the
            market reached US$28.89 billion in 2019, Packaged Facts says,
            representing a healthy 6.4% increase over 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the market research firm is projecting a slightly
            larger growth rate for 2020 – up 7% to US$31 billion – even better
            than the 6% rate originally forecast prior to the onslaught of
            COVID-19. The rosier projection comes thanks to “coronavirus-driven
            stockpiling and supplemented by increases in new pet adoptions for
            the remainder of the year,” the report says. While growth will
            moderate over the next several years, according to Packaged Facts’
            modeling, it will still increase by at least 5% a year through 2024,
            reaching US$38 billion then.
          </p>
          <h4>Lower pet food e-commerce pricing may prevail</h4>
          <p>
            Of course, e-commerce is now king, and it’s well documented how the
            pandemic and accompanying lockdowns and quarantines have driven even
            more consumers to buy online, including their pet food. A key
            takeaway from Packaged Facts’ April/May 2020 survey of pet owners is
            that 70% of dog and cat owners reported shopping in brick-and-mortar
            stores less, while at the same time, 65% reported buying online more
            as a result of the coronavirus. In addition, 64% of survey
            respondents agreed that more of their everyday spending was being
            done online, and 73% said they feel safer buying things online as
            opposed to in a store.
          </p>
          <p>
            That could actually be a boon to pet specialty retailers, including
            independents, that have been able to adopt omnichannel strategies
            offering online ordering, plus home delivery and/or curbside pickup,
            to augment their brick-and-mortar locations. A certain portion of
            U.S consumers – 79% of dog and cat owners, according to another
            Packaged Facts survey – said that, due to the coronavirus, they
            believed it was especially important to buy from local, independent
            merchants, so they may stay loyal to those retailers if they can.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet financial realities often end up dictating purchasing decisions.
            The lower prices typically offered by e-commerce giants like Amazon
            and Chewy may well win out if indeed some pet owners have to start
            cutting back on their pet food spending.
