            The cultural differences among pet owners in feeding practices may
            have changed over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dog and cat owners in various English-speaking countries may have
            developed different attitudes towards pet foods. Veterinary and pet
            nutritional scientists surveyed 3,673 dog and cat owners in
            Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United
            States. Pet owners fed different proportions of raw, homemade and
            conventional pet foods, depending on the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Very interestingly there were differences from region to region,
            with Australia having the highest rate of feeding raw foods, while
            Canada had the highest rate of feeding commercial foods," study
            co-author
            <strong
              >Dr. Sarah Dodd of the University of Guelph, Ontario, Veterinary
              College</strong
            >, said in an email. "This is consistent with what has been
            previously reported by Laflamme and colleagues in 2008. They also
            found a much higher rate of raw feeding in Australia as compared to
            the USA. It could be associated with the urban density. It's
            possible that owners of dogs living rurally in Australia may not
            have easy access to commercial dog food and may prefer to feed
            'homekill' or from hunted prey, though this doesn't account for the
            high prevalence of raw feeding within urban centers as has been
            reported previously. The common phrase 'BARF' that is used to refer
            to bones and raw food or biologically appropriate raw food was
            coined in Australia, by a veterinarian considered as the founder of
            the 'BARF movement'. This suggests a potential cultural, as opposed
            to a practical, reason for the preference for raw food."

          <p>Anglophone pet owners feeding survey</p>
          <p>
            The cultural differences among pet owners in feeding practices may
            have changed over time.
            <strong>Dodd and her colleagues</strong> observed how pet owners’
            behaviors had gradually shifted from purely conventional diets to
            include homemade or store-bought raw foods. The researchers compared
            nine previously published studies on pet owner feeding practices to
            their survey results. Veterinary Record published their findings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, most pet owners offered conventional pet foods, at 79% for
            dogs and 90% for cats. However, far fewer fed those diets
            exclusively (13% dogs, 32% cats). Many dog and cat owners also few
            their dogs other types of specially prepared meals, not including
            treats, snacks or table scraps. Pet owners gave homemade food to 64%
            of dogs and 46% of cats. Sixty-six percent of dog owners gave raw
            meals their pets, while 53% of cat owners did likewise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The study’s authors wrote that unconventional diets fed to dogs and
            cats may be nutritionally insufficient. They called on veterinarians
            to educate pet owners about pet dietary needs and these
            non-traditional pet foods.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Probably the most common nutritional imbalances that occur with
            unbalanced diets, both raw and cooked, are imbalances of dietary
            calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D causing metabolic bone disease -
            especially in young, growing animals," <strong>Dodd said</strong>.
            "Clinically, we also see a lot of gastroenteritis in dogs who happen
            to be fed raw foods, but it's tricky to attribute that to the diet
            without culturing the feces and the diet and finding the same
            pathogen in both - and it can be hard to get that diet sample as the
            raw foods are typically packaged in small quantities and we need a
            sample of the very same food the dog was eating, not even another
            package from the same batch would suffice. Constipation and
            obstipation is also very common due to the high content of
            indigestible bone in these foods."
