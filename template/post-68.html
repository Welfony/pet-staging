            Feeding pets like people continues to drive pet food sales growth
            and innovation,
            <strong
              >David Sprinkle, publisher and research director of Packaged
              Facts</strong
            >
            said in his presentation at Petfood Forum CONNECT. As part of that
            humanization of pet food, people who look for natural, organic,
            animal welfare and similar marketing claims may tend to seek those
            qualities in ingredients used in their pets’ diets.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sustainability, animal welfare and ethical sourcing of ingredients,
            those all have a lot of play remaining in the overall pet food
            market, both mass and specialty,” <strong>Sprinkle</strong> said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly half of respondents to a
            <strong>Packaged Facts</strong> survey either somewhat agreed (29%)
            or strongly agreed (21%) with the statement that they consider
            natural and organic pet food to be safer than regular food. The
            survey included approximately 1,000 pet owners from a representative
            demographic sample in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural and organic pet food also ties into other issues with these
            products, he said, including cage-free poultry and non-GMO.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The idea of safety also gets into animal welfare issues and
            agriculture issues spilling over into these different attitudes and
            approaches that go beyond the simple nuts and bolts of pet food,”
            <strong>Sprinkle</strong> said.
          </p>
          <p>Pet owner awareness of livestock welfare</p>
          <p>
            In <strong>Packaged Facts</strong>’ survey, the degree of concern
            about ethical treatment of animals raised for pet food and treats
            ranked near consumers’ degree of concern about artificial
            ingredients in pet food.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a pet food company does choose to market their products as
            using humanely raised livestock or other sustainability claim, they
            need to walk the walk. Pet owners who care about social and
            ecological issues tend to be studious. Pet food brands can help
            consumers by providing information on their own website and other
            media channels. However, pet food marketers shouldn’t expect
            consumers to limit themselves to commercial websites’ official
            views.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animal welfare, ethical sourcing and other aspects of sustainability
            continue to grow as influences on pet food customer decisions. Pet
            foods developed to meet these trends present both innovation
            opportunities and public scrutiny.
