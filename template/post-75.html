          <p>1. Beef: A popular, complicated ingredient in dog and cat diets</p>
          <p>
            Beef has been a principal ingredient in dog and cat diets for
            decades. Although it lost a bit of popularity a few years ago as
            chicken took over the top spot in most pet foods, beef-based
            ingredients are still considered a preferred choice by many pet
            owners.
          </p>
          <p>2. Cheese: A fun food ingredient for pets and their owners</p>
          <p>
            Cheese is found in several pet foods and treats; maybe not as the
            main ingredient, but certainly as a flavour or complementary feature
            to entice pets and their owners. Cheese promotes fun and diversity
            to their otherwise pedestrian flavour choices.
          </p>
          <p>3. Freeze-dried meat and pet food</p>
          <p>
            Dehydrated meat-containing foods have become popular in the pet food
            aisle in the last few years. They seem to be positioned
            counter-opposite to conventional extruded pet foods and as an
            alternative to raw foods for the nutrition-conscious or very
            high-involvement pet owners.
          </p>
          <p>4. Organ meats: quality source of protein for pets</p>
          <p>
            Organ meats have been called a multitude of names like viscera,
            entrails, tripe, paunch, offal and giblets. Despite the 18th-century
            monikers, they are the working internal organs, the guts, of the
            pig, chicken, cow, sheep or fish from which they derive.
          </p>
          <p>5. Whey your protein options</p>
          <p>
            It is becoming increasingly common to find pet foods that contain
            whey, a milk protein, as a prominent ingredient on their labels.
