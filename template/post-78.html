            Functional options in the pet space are gaining ground. Whether it’s
            in the form of pet foods (which claim to provide health and wellness
            benefits beyond the “complete and balanced” requirements for pet
            nutrition), pet treats (which often make singular claims such as
            dental health or calming) or pet supplements and vitamins (which run
            the gamut from all-in-one preventives to symptom-specific options),
            pet parents are looking for ways to take better care of their pets
            that don’t include a veterinarian and/or pharmaceuticals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a March 31, 2021 presentation titled, “<strong
              >The pet food and treats industry: Reflecting on the past,
              understanding the present, anticipating the future,” Packaged
              Facts Research Director (and regular Petfood Industry magazine
              columnist) David Sprinkle</strong
            >
            presented data on recent pet supplement purchasing. According to the
            data, 34% of those surveyed said they’re purchasing dog
            vitamins/supplements, while 24% said they’re purchasing cat
            vitamins/supplements. These numbers, are, notably, higher than the
            percentages who said they are purchasing functional treats for dogs
            and cats (21% and 17%, respectively, not including dental treats).
          </p>
          <p>
            They’re not alone. According to market research and consulting
            company Grand View Research, the global pet supplements market size
            was valued at US$637.6 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a
            compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2020 to 2027.
          </p>
          <h4>Pet owners paying more attention</h4>
          <p>
            The past year found pet owners spending more time than ever with
            their pets, and amidst a global pandemic preventive health in the
            human and pet spaces became a focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            These demands track well with what pet owners look for when they’re
            searching for preventive health or treatment solutions in the pet
            food aisles — it’s well known that many pet parents will look at
            nutrition as the first line of defence for their pet’s health. But
            pet foods aren’t necessarily meant to address specific health
            concerns, as their primary purpose is overall balanced nutrition, so
            pet owners are increasingly willing to look at additional offerings
            in the same place they’d go for themselves: the supplement space.
          </p>
          <h4>The need for consumer education</h4>
          <p>
            Unsurprisingly, education is a huge component of those dealing in
            pet supplements, ensuring that consumers understand their options
            and can intelligently choose what might be right for their animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            All that assumes, of course, that pet owners find themselves in the
            supplement space to begin with.
