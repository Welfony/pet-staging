            <strong>Leading U.K.-.based cat charity International Cat Care (iCatCare)</strong> launched their ‘Cat Care
            for Life’ program at the 2018 <strong>British Small Animal Veterinary Association Congress (BSAVA)</strong>,
            and it may well have an impact on the pet food industry. While previously lifestages, and therefore
            lifestage-specific food, covered kitten, adult and senior, iCatCare has reclassified the lifespan of a cat
            into six lifestages – kitten, junior, adult, mature, senior and super senior. Aimed at both cat owners and
            veterinary clinics, the program's goal is to encourage owners to understand the lifestages of their cat and
            work with their vet to keep their cats as healthy as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            “For many years of a cat's life they often appear youthful and it can be very difficult to tell the age of
            an adult cat. The <strong>Cat Care for Life</strong> program has been designed to help cat owners keep their
            cat happy and healthy throughout all of their lives. The program has six lifestages, which are based on how
            cats mature and age both physically and behaviorally.” said Sarah Endersby, veterinary development manager
            at iCatCare. “These lifestages allow us to predict when certain changes might be occurring during the cat's
            life (although of course, each cat will mature and age at different rates, so the age ranges should be
            considered as a guide). There are also other considerations such as diet and nutrition, which will vary as
            the cat ages.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The popularity and prestige of iCatCare as an organization, and the reach it has across the U.K., Europe,
            and beyond, means that cat-owning consumers will no doubt be looking more closely at the different lifestage
            foods on offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does this mean for manufacturers?
          </p>
          <p>
            The European Pet Food Industry Federation (FEDIAF) already has nutritional guidelines for pet food
            manufacturers to follow, and the nutritional needs of pets at different lifestages are detailed in the
            guidelines. For example, there is a maximum level of lysine allowed in puppy food, because an excess is
            shown to hinder healthy weight gain in puppies.
