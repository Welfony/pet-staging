            Many industry professionals have witnessed the internet go from a new frontier to an essential part of pet
            food sales and communications strategies for brands worldwide. As digital commerce and e-communications grew
            in importance, they also diversified into numerous platforms, from traditional websites and e-mail to
            Instagram and podcasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Integrating a pet food brands’ efforts across those platforms is the key to developing a strong digital
            presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pet food e-commerce and pet owner education
            <br />
            When implemented well, pet food brands’ digital presence serves to educate consumers while making it
            convenient to purchase products.
          </p>
          <p>
            When presenting pet foods and treats for sale online, many of the rules of marketing learned in
            brick-and-mortar retail outlets no longer apply. Shelf placement and share no longer matter. Consumers can’t
            be swayed by premium packaging if all they see is a thumbnail image.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, pet food companies can follow three guidelines to improve the effectiveness of their online retail
            presentation of products.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Price and discount</strong> – Make sure the price is clearly visible. Consumers don’t like to
              wait until an item is in the cart to find out the price. Note any discount prominently.</li>
            <li><strong>Product images</strong> – Use high-resolution images of the product itself, not the package.
              Another good option is to use an photo of the food with content dog and happy family.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits</strong> – In the description, mention the products benefits, as opposed to its
              characteristics. In other words, describe how protein helps a dog before declaring the percentage of
              protein present.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Other features of websites tend to distract pet owners or worse, annoy them. For example, pop-ups, cookies
            and registrations can make people uncomfortable or annoyed. Optimizing loading speed across platforms and
            devices also boosts customers likelihood to follow through to the shopping cart. On the other hand, hen you
            go to a website and it doesn’t load quickly. Um, bye.
