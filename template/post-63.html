            According to one research team, greenhouse gas emissions associated
            with kibble production accounted for 1.1 to 2.9% of total
            agricultural emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            While exactly how much pet food production contributes to climate
            change remains a wide-ranging estimate, a research team in Scotland
            calculated that dog food may be associated with higher greenhouse
            gas emissions and land use than cat food. Likewise, premium dog and
            cat foods may correlate with more climate changing pollution than
            conventional varieties.
          </p>
          <p>Previous estimate of pet food environmental impact</p>
          <p>
            In 2017, <strong>PLoS ONE</strong> published an estimate that dog
            and cat food ingredients account for approximately 25-30% of U.S.
            meat-related ecological impacts. However, other scientists pointed
            out flaws in the methodology, such as assuming that all by-products
            could be used for human food. Similarly, previous estimates of pet
            food’s contribution to climate change assigned an equal value to the
            amount of greenhouse gas associated with muscle meat as with
            by-products. In other words, filet mignon and beef meal were
            considered equally, whereas the production of the prime steak led to
            the existence of byproducts to be rendered into meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of byproducts keeps nutritious morsels like chicken hearts
            and pig kidneys from being wasted. It also provides an economic
            input for ranchers, making their operations more financially viable,
            so byproducts need to be considered in environmental impacts,

            paper. In their own study, the researchers estimated greenhouse gas
            emissions and resource use associated with global dry dog and cat
            food production. To address byproducts, the researchers assessed the
            economic value of byproducts as a percentage of the total value of
            that animal’s products. By-products were then assigned a
            corresponding percentage of that livestock’s resource use and
            climate change contribution. Likewise, the scientists assigned
            different weighting to the top five ingredients and discerned
            between premium versus standard formulations, as well as differences
            between cat and dog diets. While by-products and formulations were
            considered, the study didn’t include everything. Wet and raw dog or
            cat foods’ effects weren’t estimated, nor were any other type of
            animals’ diets. The study didn’t consider packaging, transportation
            and administrative contributions to the pet food industry’s
            environmental effects.

            Greenhouse gas production and resource use by pet food production
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Alexander’s research team, greenhouse gas emissions
            associated with kibble production accounted for 1.1 to 2.9% of total
            agricultural emissions. Those percentages equated to the equivalent
            of between 56 and 151 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Worldwide, the
            equivalent of 41 to 58 million hectares of agricultural land are
            devoted to pet food ingredient production, or 0.8 to 1.2% of the
            global total. Pet food production accounted for 5 to 11 cubic
            kilometers of freshwater use, making up 0.2 to 0.4% of all water
            extracted for agriculture. Approximately 70% of the greenhouse gas
            emissions associated with kibble production comes from animal
            products, including both meat and byproducts. For water usage,
            approximately 50 to 60% relates to crop products within pet foods.
            Poultry and its byproducts were the most abundant animal products,
            while corn was the most prevalent plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among premium and conventional, as well as dog versus cat,
            formulations, the researchers noted differences with implications
            for those recipes’ environmental effects. Comparing categories of
            pet foods, higher proportions of meat resulted in greater greenhouse
            emissions and agricultural land use, the researchers wrote. Premium
            brands contributed 3.3 times more towards climate change compared to
            conventional cat food and 2.3 times that of conventional dog food.
            Dog food accounted for 1.6 times the emissions of cat food.
