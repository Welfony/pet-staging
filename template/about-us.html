            </div>
            <p>
              We carefully make appropriate foods from fresh regional
              ingredients. Unmatched by any other dog or cat food, our fresh
              regional ingredients rival mother nature , supplying nutrients in
              their freshest, most natural and nourishing form. Our kitchens
              provide inspiration for our foods and world-class ingredients from
              Australian farmers and hunters directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our key actives are backed by over 40 years’ experience, and are
              endorsed by zookeepers, dog owners and veterinarians. We use only
              the highest-quality-human-grade dairy sourced from Australia’s
              golden milk belt region. Our materials meet the high standards of
              GMP, HACCP and SQF. We are proud to provide an authentic and
              trusted Australian made product, that supports growth in the local
              industry.

              Our commitment to animal health is reflected in the innovation and
              consistent quality of our products. We start with the most up to
              date nutritional knowledge backed by research and product testing
              to create products that are natural and nutritionally balanced.
              The main methods of testing revolve around palatability and
              digestibility of our products under controlled and supervised
              feeding trials, ensuring the continued high quality of our
              products.
