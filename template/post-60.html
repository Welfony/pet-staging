            The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought consumer priorities into
            sharp focus, particularly as the illness continues to dominate the
            news, local and national government policy, and the way people are
            finding new patterns to conduct their days. What has continued to be
            a strong focus, at least for pet owners, are the furry, scaly and
            feathery friends who pre-pandemic might have been home alone all
            day, but are now sharing a larger part of their lives with the
            humans who are now telecommuting or simply not frequenting their
            local haunts or headed off for vacations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2020, the
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline"
              >American Pet Products Association (APPA) </strong
            >released the “APPA COVID-19 Pulse Study of Pet Ownership during the
            Pandemic,” which found that pet ownership is holding steady during
            the pandemic, and a majority of pet owners reported that their
            spending hasn’t been influenced by the state of the economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We know just how much pets mean to us, our mental health and
            well-being,” said
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline"
              >Steve King, CEO of the APPA</strong
            >. “This initial study reaffirms that pet owners are appreciating
            the benefits of pet ownership now more than ever, which is
            incredible to hear.”
          </p>
          <h4>Pets get equal consideration during a crisis</h4>
          <p>
            Pets are credited with helping their humans with everything from
            mood to security to exercise and more, and surveys being conducted
            now really bear that out in these extraordinary times.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline">APPA’s study</strong>,
            72% of owners agree that spending time with their pet is helping to
            reduce their stress and increase their sense of well-being during
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 70% say they’re spending more
            time with their pet right now and 60% say the extra time spent with
            their pet makes them feel closer and more bonded to their pet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spending-wise, there’s more good news for the pet industry. The
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline">APPA study</strong> shows
            that 64% of pet owners surveyed have spent the same amount of money
            on their pets as they did pre-pandemic — and 21% have spent either a
            little or a lot more. On the other hand, only 15% have spent either
            a little or a lot less on their pets since the pandemic began.
