            The COVID-19 pandemic has put health and wellness concerns front and
            centre, with both human and pet health care markets as key
            beneficiaries. The spotlight on disease and prevention has sharpened
            pet owners’ focus on the overall health of their pets, with 41% of
            pet owners indicating that they are paying closer attention to their
            pets’ health and wellness because of COVID-19 and 14% changing the
            health care products they buy their pets, based on
            <strong>
              Packaged Facts’ November–December 2020 Survey of Pet
              Owners.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            For the pet nutrition products industry, all of this attention to
            disease prevention and wellness means more pet owners are seeking
            out solutions to the health issues they are noticing while spending
            more time in closer contact with their pets. It also means that pet
            owners are thinking more proactively, looking for ways to head off
            health issues in the first place by taking preventative measures. In
            last month’s column, 55% of dog households and 53% of cat households
            have senior pets, with the senior share of the pet dog population up
            by 10 percentage points from 45% in 2014 to 55% in 2020.

          <h4>Pet supplement market growth</h4>
          <p>
            With the increased focus on health and wellness brought on by the
            pandemic, the pet supplements market — including CBD products in
            particular — has been getting a lot of attention as pet owners seek
            out products that address common health problems, such as anxiety
            and pain-management products.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of November–December 2020, pet supplement usage rates were at 38%
            among dog owners and 19% among cat owners, up from 29% and 17% in
            spring 2019. Reflecting the heightened interest is a 21% surge in
            pet supplement sales — quadrupling the average annual increase of
            the past five years — bringing 2020 sales to nearly US$800 million,
            as reported in
            <strong
              >Packaged Facts’ Pet Supplements in the U.S. (January
              2021)</strong
            >. Given their consumer reputation as strong preventive medicine,
            not to mention the fact that they don’t require prescriptions, the
            pet supplement market’s growth is easy to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming the role of COVID-19 in pumping up sales is avid demand
            for products targeting immunity and anxiety, with joint/mobility,
            skin/coat, dental and probiotic supplements and with CBD supplements
            hotter than ever. The ongoing and residual impact of the pandemic,
            the strong prospects and “halo effect” of CBD on the pet supplements
            business, the large numbers of senior and overweight pets, and the
            overall pet industry spotlight on pet health are expected to keep
            pet supplements on a steady upward trajectory, with sales topping
            US$900 million by 2025.
