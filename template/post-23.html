            Beyond the traditional game of catch in the park, pet owners now want to share more of their outdoor
            adventures with their pets, especially dogs. People too pay more attention to the foods they eat to fuel
            their lifestyles and seek out ingredients that match their focus on health and well-being.
          </p>
          <h4>1. Carefree Joy</h4>
          <p>
            Pet owners want to know that the foods they feed their pets are not harming their animals’ health. In
            particular, free-from claims have become important drivers in pet owners’ choices. Whether it’s GMOs, corn
            or gluten, pet owners avoid specific ingredients out of concerns for safety and health, regardless of
            whether evidence backs up their fears or not. While pets’ actual sensitivities to certain ingredients may be
            more abstract than empirical, people will avoid pet foods that contain those constituents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, people want to see their pets’ joy in eating without fears or guilt. Pet food makers can adapt
            to this “carefree joy” trend by trading conventional ingredients for alternatives with less stigma, such as
            using brown rice in place of white rice. Avoiding ingredients that people are becoming more concerned about,
            such as carrageenan, can also help pet food companies stay ahead of consumers’ fears.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Performance fuel</h4>
          <p>
            Along with avoiding some ingredients perceived as risky, pet food makers need to keep an eye on which
            ingredients consumers believe boost their health and athletic performance. The high protein trend serves as
            an example of this. Diet trends in human food enhanced pet owners demand for high-meat, protein-rich pet
            foods as “performance fuel.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, protein bars accompany many people on their camping and hiking trips. Pet food makers have
            latched onto this by creating portable, nutrition meal bars for pets, such as the Out Bar for dogs. Using
            wholesome, nutrient-dense ingredients can help brands meet consumers’ demands for pet foods that fuel a pet
            during adventures.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Preventive care</h4>
          <p>
            To embark on those adventures, people and pets can’t be ill. Increasingly, people look to avoid health
            problems through their diet, and like so many other trends, they want to do the same for their pets. People
            want their pets’ food to help the animals stay youthful, vital and vigorous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pet food producers have met this trend with products like dental chews that proactively clean pets’ teeth.
            Other manufacturers market their pet foods and treats as boosting pets’ wellness with cannabidiol.
