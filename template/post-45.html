            Minerals play a key role in a petâ€™s nutrition, as they should be available in the right amounts to provide a
            healthy and balanced diet. Because there are several types of minerals serving different purposes, consumers
            might get confused about the specific features of each of them.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Essentials nutrients for pet health
          </h4>
          <p>
            Minerals are essential nutrients for reproduction, growth and longevity of the pet. All minerals are unique,
            as their effects are not replaceable with another mineral. Thus, pet food manufacturers are increasingly
            seeking the best alternatives to introduce differentiated products that provide more added value, including
            a well-adjusted provision of minerals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet the tendency to use minerals might be facing opposition. First, consumers are increasingly requiring
            more information on the products they are purchasing. On the other hand, veterinarians are pushing to
            include only the right mineral mix on pet food products, as most metabolic-related ailments are directly
            associated with the metabolism of minerals.
          </p>
          <h4>Different types of minerals available</h4>
          <p>
            Pet food products may improve according to the mix and type of minerals used. Organic minerals, for
            instance, have the best bioavailability and absorption features; next in importance are hydroxy-minerals
            and, lastly, inorganic minerals, which possess the lowest bioavailability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientific studies have demonstrated that minerals impact palatability, as there is a close link between
            this feature and the diversity of mineral formulas that are available.
